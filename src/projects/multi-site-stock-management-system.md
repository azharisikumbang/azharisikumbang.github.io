The project based-on some business use-case from a distributor for seeds and fertilizers company. We covered three main cases, they are manage stocks on multi warehouses (isolated), to track sales canvasses activity and syncronize moving-stock accross warehouses.

## Demo UX Flow

## Problem and Solutions

What are the problems and what we proposed,

1. The old excel-based workflows is messy, not because the excel, but how they using the excel. The excel they created is unstandarized, admin-oriented and hard to understand in first place (not just one warehouse). It also just stored in one laptop, no backup, when it crashed it's gone. So, we optimize this process with web-based management system.
2. The canvasses activity takes 5-7 days to return back and report the sales to the offices. This is a problem, when the purchasing division trying to re-order the stocks, they should know what stocks is sold as soon as possible. They are already has a strategy for this, but we proposed other options to make the sales staf record the sales as soon as possible.
3. The moving-stocks between warehouses. When stocks moving from a warehouse to another, it takes 3-4 days (administration, distance, etc) to receive the confirmation. Again, sometimes, the purchasing needs to order new stocks. And we proposed to a single click button to syncronize the stocks on sender and receiver warehouse.
4. The management needs to know a real-time stocks report whenever, not need to wait the staf to create it first.
